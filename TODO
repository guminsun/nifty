Abstract
Pretty picture of the phases:
    lexer -> parser -> organizer -> analyzer -> translator -> emitter

...


Tests
-----
Expected output.


Organizer
---------
organize_statement_list is broken for:

acer
{
    card_1
    {
        nendf = 20;
        npend = 21;
        ngend = 22;
        nace = 23;
        ndir = 24;
    }

    card_2
    {
        iopt = 2;
        nxtra = 1;
    }

    card_3
    {
        hk = "A string.";
    }

    card_4
    {}
}

acer: see brokenness above
    Kind of finished. Needs cleaning?
