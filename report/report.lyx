Background
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Usability of software systems is important.
 The usability of a software system is determined, among other things, by
 its user interface.
 The user interface of a software system should provide means of interaction
 between the users and the system such that the desired result can be produced
 in an easy, elegant, and efficient fashion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The NJOY Nuclear Data Processing System 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-1"

\end_inset

 is a software system used for nuclear data management.
 In particular, it is used to convert evaluated nuclear data for materials
 stored in Evaluated Nuclear Data Files (ENDF) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-2"

\end_inset

 into different formats, as well as performing operations on the data.
 ENDF is a file format used for storing nuclear data which has been produced
 through an evaluation process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
NJOY is widely used within nuclear data research, and as such, it is important
 that the system has a user friendly interface.
 NJOY is currently being used within the MACRO project 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-3"

\end_inset

 at the Division of Applied Nuclear Physics, at the Department of Physics
 and Astronomy at Uppsala University.
 MACRO is a project that aims at linking reactor parameter uncertainties
 to uncertainties in nuclear cross sections and nuclear model parameters.
 This will be done using Monte Carlo-methods, and will require nuclear data
 processing on a large scale.
 It has been apparent to the researchers within the project that the non-interac
tive user interface used for specifying NJOY jobs is not as user friendly
 as one would like.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Problem Description
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The NJOY input instructions 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-1,key-4"

\end_inset

 are used for specifying jobs to be run by NJOY.
 It is a non-interactive user interface in the sense that the entire job
 needs to be specified prior to feeding the job to NJOY.
 No further input will be given when the processing of the job has started.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The NJOY input instructions are complex and hard to read compared to e.g.
 a high-level programming language.
 For example, algorithm 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref
reference "alg:NJOY Example 1"

\end_inset

 is a 
\emph on
short
\emph default
 and 
\emph on

\emph default
 NJOY job which illustrates what the input instructions look like.

Without consulting the documentation, one might guess that line 4 and 11
 are some kind of descriptive titles, which is correct.
 One might also guess that line 14 terminates the program.
 However, it is not obvious that line 2 denotes input and output files (each
 number indicates a specific file) that the system will operate on.
 It is also hard to deduce that the first number on line 5 denotes the material
 to be processed, and that the second number denotes the desired temperature
 in kelvin.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The input instructions can be annotated with descriptive comments, but even
 then, working with a large and complex job easily becomes a daunting and
 error-prone task.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Objective
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The NJOY input instructions is not an optimal input format.
 Therefore, the scope of this thesis has been to design and implement a
 more user friendly, and readable input format.
 The design of the new input format could be based on some commonly known
 existing format that is fitting to the task.
 The basis could for example be a programming language.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to make the new input format useable with NJOY, it has to be translated
 into the original NJOY input instructions.
 As such, the scope of this work also included developing an accompanying
 translator for the new input format.

NJOY Input Instructions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The NJOY input instructions is described in reference 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "key-1,key-4"

\end_inset

.
 A brief summary of the general structure of the input instructions is provided
 in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

General Structure

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
NJOY is composed by a set of modules where each module performs a specific
 task.
 Each module has its separate input specification, which defines the expected
 input instructions for the module.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An NJOY job is an ordered sequence of modules, where the order denotes the
 execution order.
 The name of a module is used to denote the start of the corresponding module
 and its specific input instructions.
 The input instructions for a module is composed by an ordered sequence
 of 
\shape italic
cards
\shape default
.
 A 
\shape italic
card
\shape default
 is a line with an ordered sequence of values separated by spaces (or commas).
 A card may be terminated with a slash character to denote the end of the
 card, but it is not required.
 Algorithm

Line 1 denotes the start of the first module and its specific input instructions.
 Line 2 denotes the first card for the module declared on line 1.
 Line 3 through 5 denotes input instructions for successive cards that also
 belongs to the module declared on line 1.
 Line 6 through 10 denotes the declaration of another module and its correspondi
ng cards.
 Successive module definitions, lines 11 through 18, may follow.
 Line 8 and 16 shows cards that have been terminated with the slash character,
 denoting that no more values has been defined for the cards.
 An NJOY job is terminated by the 
\family typewriter
stop
\family default
 instruction as indicated by line 19.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The expected cards in a module and the expected values within a card depends
 on the specific input specification for the module.
 The expected type of the values also depends on the input specification
 for the specific card and module.
 There are three kinds of types that the values in a card may be defined
 as: floating-point numbers, natural numbers (integers), and character strings.
 Character strings are generally required to be terminated by a slash character.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A card may have default values.
 A default value is a value that does not have to be defined in an NJOY
 job.
 If the value is not defined, then a default value will be set by NJOY.
 Values that may be defaulted are always defined at the end of the card.
 Hence, the values in a card are organized such that values that must be
 defined are always defined prior to values that may be defaulted.
 Default values will be used when a card is terminated by a slash character.
 For example, according to reference 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-4"

\end_inset

, card 3 in the 
\family typewriter
reconr
\family default
 module is composed by three values.
 The last two values have default values.
 Declaring the card as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align center

\family typewriter
value/
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
will set the first value to 
\family typewriter
value
\family default
 while the last two values will be set to their default values internally
 by NJOY since no more values were defined in the card.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Note Comment
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
For example, the first card in a module is generally used to denote input
 and output files (e.g.
 ENDF libraries) to the module.
 Input and output files that the system operates on are expected to be defined
 as integer values.
 NJOY also expects input and output files to be named by a special convention.
 The file names are expected to be prefixed with 
\family typewriter
tape
\family default
, and suffixed with the integer number that was specified in the card.
 For example, if an input file was defined as the integer 20, then NJOY
 expects a file named 
\family typewriter
tape20
\family default
 to be available.
 This allows output files from one module to be used as the input files
 for another module, which is how data flows from one module to another
 in an NJOY job.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To conclude, the NJOY input instructions are powerful.
 It is possible to construct a complex NJOY job by declaring a long chain
 of modules with their specific input instructions.
 Or, an NJOY job may be as simple as a single 
\family typewriter
stop
\family default
 instruction, which just terminates the job.

Methodology
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The NJOY input instructions had to be understood in order to design the
 new input format.
 Each module in the NJOY software system, as described in reference 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-1,key-4"

\end_inset

, was analyzed separately such that a general structure and common language
 features could be extracted and used for further analysis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The NJOY modules are listed in table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Modules to be implemented"

\end_inset

.
 The modules have been prioritized with a number.
 The number indicates the importance level of the module to the MACRO project
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-3"

\end_inset

.
 A low number indicates high priority, e.g.
 a module with a low number had to be implemented before a module with a
 higher number.

 The translator should report an error if these rules are violated; such
 as when card 1 has not been defined or when card 3 has been defined prior
 to card 2.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Type checking is another important part of the semantic analysis where the
 translator checks that each operator has valid operands.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, the identifier

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An assignment denotes that a left hand side is assigned to hold the values
 of a right hand side.
 A left hand side is an ordered list of elements, where the elements can
 be an array or identifier.
 A right hand side is an ordered list of elements, where the elements can
 be a float, integer, null or a string.
 As such, a value definition is an array or identifier that has been declared
 to hold the value of either a floating-point number, natural number, empty
 string or a character string.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As indicated by the grammar, NIF supports multiple assignment.
 That is, multiple identifiers can be assigned in the same expression.
 For example, the expression
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align center

\family typewriter
material, temp = 9237, 300.0;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
denotes that the identifier 
\family typewriter
material
\family default
 holds the integer 9237, and the identifier 
\family typewriter
temp
\family default
 holds the float 300.0.
 The syntax analysis in the parser enforces that the number of elements
 on both sides of an assignment are the same.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The translator, NJOY Input Format Translator (
\family typewriter
nifty
\family default
), was constructed as a set of modules where each module implements a specific
 phase in the translation process.
 Five phases have been implemented as part of the translation process and
 are shown in figure 1.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first phase is the lexical analysis which is implemented by the lexer
 module.
 The second phase, syntax analysis, is implemented by the parser module.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The third phase, implemented by the organizer module, is a special phase
 where the order of the statements in a card are analyzed and possible rearrange
d.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The fourth phase is the semantic analysis which is implemented by the module
 named analyzer.
 The fifth, and final, phase of the translator is the emitter module which
 implements a NJOY input instructions generator.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A basic user manual for the translator is available in appendix 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref
reference "sec:Appendix - User Manual"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Reserved Keywords
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An important design choice is that the translator will enforce the use of
 reserved keywords to specify NIF programs.
 It will not only consider card and module names as reserved keywords, but
 also identifier names.
 As such, it is not possible to use an identifier name until it has been
 defined as an identifier in the translator.
 Similarly, it is not possible to use a card or module name which has not
 been defined in the translator.
 This restricts the expressiveness of the input format, but allows detailed
 analysis of the semantics in the organizer and analyzer modules.
 As a consequence, it also forces the user to write consistent and readable
 input files -- which has been the objective of this work.

The Modules
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sub:Implementation, The Modules"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Lexer
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The lexer is responsible for recognizing character patterns and generating
 the appropriate NIF tokens.
 As input, the lexer expects a NIF program and will generate a token stream
 as its output unless the lexer detects a lexical error.
 If a lexical error is detected, an error message will be reported and the
 translation process will stop at this phase.
 The lexer will only recognize card and module names which are specified
 in reference 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-4"

\end_inset

, thus enforcing the use of a specific set of cards and modules as mentioned
 previously.
 The lexer also recognizes comments in the input program.
 The comments will be discarded during the lexical analysis and thus won't
 be passed on to the next phase in the translation process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Parser
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The parser is responsible for enforcing the structure of the NIF grammar
 and constructing the syntax tree.
 As input, the parser expects a stream of tokens generated by the lexer.
 The parser will produce a syntax tree as its output, which represents the
 structure of the NIF program.
 If the parser detects a syntax error, an error message will be reported
 and the translation process will stop at this phase.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Organizer
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The organizer analyzes the syntax tree produced by the parser.
 Its purpose is to rearrange the statements in a card such that they appear
 in the expected, working order.
 As such, it should be possible to write a NIF program without having to
 list the statements in a card in the expected order as indicated by reference
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-4"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The NJOY modules and the cards within the modules still needs to be given
 in the correct order though.
 This is due to the fact that the number of possible NJOY jobs is infinite
 (all may not be functional in the NJOY software system, though).
 An infinite number of NJOY jobs can simply be created by just appending
 another module specification to an existing NJOY job in order to create
 a new one.
 Simply stated, the translator can not guess the intention of the job due
 to the number of possible combinations the modules may be listed in.
 Hence, the modules must be provided in the expected order by the user.
 Cards are not arrangeable either, since they also are prone to be repetitive.
 It is not possible to determine which card should go first from a set of
 cards (with the same name) which e.g.
 only contains a descriptive title.
 The cards must also be provided in the expected order by the user.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each NJOY module requires its own organizer implementation since each module
 has its specific set of rules as described in reference 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-4"

\end_inset

.
 Since the identifier names are hardwired in the translator, the organizer
 is able to do a detailed analysis of the syntax tree and easily detect
 if a specific identifier has been defined out of order.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If any statements have been provided out of order in a card, and the organizer
 is able to arrange the statements, a new syntax tree is returned where
 the statements have been ordered in the expected sequence.
 If the organizer somehow fails to organize the syntax tree, it will return
 the original syntax tree as produced by the parser and pass it on to the
 next phase in the translation process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Analyzer
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The analyzer expects a syntax tree as its input.
 Like in the organizer phase, the NJOY modules needs to be analyzed separately
 since each module has its specific set of rules.
 As such, each module also requires its own analyzer implementation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The analyzer basically visits every node in the order they appear in the
 syntax tree and checks if it is the expected one.
 The analysis can be made very detailed since the translator can, to some
 extent, predict the next card or identifier due to the ordered nature described
 in reference 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-4"

\end_inset

.
 Since the cards and the identifiers have reserved names, the analyzer is
 able to easily determine whether a card or an identifier is the expected
 one.
 Using reserved names also makes type checking easy, since a reserved identifier
 in a specific card may be associated with a specific type, range, size,
 length, et cetera.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The analyzer does not alter the syntax tree, it just analyzes it.
 The input syntax tree will be the output of the analyzer if the syntax
 tree is semantically correct according to the translator.
 If the analyzer detects a semantic error in the syntax tree, an error message
 will be reported and the translation process will stop at this phase.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Emitter
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The emitter expects a syntax tree as its input and it is responsible for
 generating NJOY input instructions from the syntax tree.
 The emitter simply flattens the tree structure and formats the instructions
 to their corresponding counterparts in the NJOY input instructions format.
 The emitter returns a string with the resulting NJOY input instructions.
 Each card in the resulting output has been annotated with a descriptive
 comment, indicating which card it is, to make it easier to find errors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Translation Verification
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As previously described in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref
reference "sub:Testing"

\end_inset

, the NJOY test problems 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-1"

\end_inset

 were manually translated into NIF programs expressing the equivalent NJOY
 jobs.
 The resulting NIF programs were used for verifying that the implementation
 was working appropriately by setting up a test suite using the Python unit
 testing framework 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-9"

\end_inset

.
 Each test problem was set up to be run through each individual phase in
 the translation process, and each run were expected to be successful since
 the NIF programs should be an equivalent and functional version of the
 original test problems.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The resulting output, as produced by the emitter, was compared with the
 expected output.
 That is, each NIF version of the test problems were compared with its correspon
ding original NJOY test problem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that modified versions of the original NJOY test problems had to be
 used as the expected output when comparing the resulting output from the
 translator.
 The comments that the emitter appends to every card had to be appended
 to the expected output such that the comparison could be performed.

\begin_layout Subsection
Translation Efficiency
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A simple Python script was written to check the resulting translation efficiency
 of the translator.
 Two different notions of timing were used in the script, namely 
\shape italic
process time
\shape default
 and 
\shape italic
wall time
\shape default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Process time is the time that the entire task spent executing on the processor,
 measured by 
\family typewriter
time.clock()
\family default
 which should be used for timing algorithms 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-9"

\end_inset

.
 Wall time is the time that elapsed from when the task was started to when
 the task finished, measured by checking the difference in time using 
\family typewriter
time.time()
\family default
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-9"

\end_inset

.
 The main difference between process time and wall time is that wall time
 is the time it takes until the system delivers the computed result, whereas
 process time is the time that it took to compute the result.

\begin_layout Section
Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
NJOY Input Format (
\family typewriter
NIF
\family default
)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As indicated by the examples listed in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref
reference "sub:NJOY Input Format Examples"

\end_inset

, a typical NIF program is vertically long compared to the compact notation
 of the NJOY input instructions.
 NIF programs can of course be specified in a compact form as well, e.g.
 on a single line, but this is not the intended usage of NIF.
 The purpose of NIF is to make NJOY jobs readable.
 The readability would be limited if the jobs were expressed on a single
 line.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The proposed grammar does not differ much from the original NJOY input instructi
ons since it basically is an annotated version of them.
 The NIF grammar could have been expanded to include more complex programming
 idioms, such as an 
\family typewriter
if
\family default
 expression to allow flow control in a NIF program.
 Although, the structure of NIF was designed to be simple and to closely
 resemble the original input instructions such that a user does not need
 to learn a completely new programming language to specify NJOY jobs.
 Another intention of this design choice is that the NJOY input instructions
 documented in reference 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-4"

\end_inset

 can be used to specify NJOY jobs in NIF.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
NJOY Input Format Translator (
\family typewriter
nifty
\family default
)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The translator is able to translate NIF programs into functional NJOY input
 instructions, but an organizer and analyzer has not been provided for all
 modules in the NJOY software system due to time constraints of this thesis.
 As such, the important semantic analysis of the translator is incomplete.
 However, much of the needed functionality and structure is provided by
 the existing implementation such that both the organizer and the analyzer
 should be easy to complete.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The implementation of the analyzer module has been the most time consuming
 task when designing the translator.
 It requires detailed analysis of what kind of input the NJOY modules expect
 and how they operate on it.
 The documentation in reference 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-4"

\end_inset

 was the main resource used while implementing the semantic analysis in
 the analyzer.
 It was evident that this was not a sufficient resource for the task at
 hand.
 It does not clearly indicate the expected type for all identifiers, nor
 the expected integer ranges or length of the character strings.
 In some cases, it has also been hard to deduce which cards that must be
 supplied by just reading the documentation in reference 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-4"

\end_inset

.
 To fully check the semantics of a NIF program, the source code for the
 NJOY software system must be studied in greater detail.
 The ENDF formats must also be studied in greater detail in order to understand
 the semantics and what kind of values that the NJOY modules accept.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Translation Verification
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The testing that was conducted within this work is not rigorous enough due
 to time constraints of this thesis.
 NJOY is a large and complex program
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The source files for the NJOY software system consists of more than 100
 000 lines.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 with many possible combinations of input within each NJOY module and card.
 The NJOY test problems 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-1"

\end_inset

 which were used to test the translation functionality is a very small set
 of possible NJOY jobs.
 Hence, there is a lot of scenarios within each NJOY module that has not
 been tested.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Translation Efficiency
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The efficiency testing of the translator as described in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref
reference "sub:Results - Translation Efficiency"

\end_inset

 was conducted in a simple fashion.
 The resulting process runtimes revealed that the performance of the translator
 implementation is not a huge bottleneck, compared to the much greater wall
 times.
 The performance appeared to be good enough to fit the purpose of the translator.
 Therefore, more elaborate testing of the efficiency was not conducted.

\begin_layout Section
Conclusions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this thesis, a new input format, NJOY Input Format (
\family typewriter
NIF
\family default
), has been designed.
 A translator which is able to translate NIF into NJOY input instructions
 has been implemented.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is possible to specify basic NJOY jobs in NIF.
 The resulting NIF programs can be translated into NJOY input instructions,
 which can be run by the NJOY software system.
 Production use is although not advisable, since it has been challenging
 to conduct rigorous and complete testing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It has also been evident that analyzing the NJOY input instructions is not
 enough to design a new input format for the NJOY software system.
 Analyzing the ENDF libraries and the source code for the NJOY software
 system is required in order to build a translator which can conduct a complete
 semantic analysis for an NJOY job.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Future Work
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Future work includes completing the semantic analysis and the organizer
 feature for all modules in the NJOY software system.
 The NJOY Input Format and the translator also needs to be systematically
 evaluated and verified by a complete software quality assurance process
 as described in reference 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-15"

\end_inset

.
 The project may also be expanded to include default scenarios, which uses
 normal mode of operation per default, such that the user does not have
 to specify exhaustive NJOY jobs just to convert a library into another.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A spin-off project, that is related to developing a user friendly and readable
 input format, is to construct a graphical user interface editor which can
 display and produce NJOY input instructions in a user friendly fashion.
